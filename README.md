# CampCoin
## _DApp for crowdfunding_

CampCoin is a decentralized application to get funds for your project. It has voting system to withdraw funds.
Users who contribute/invest in your project, can vote on your request to spend money. 

It is a simple to use app. Just start a campaign and ask others to support :)

## Features

- Create a campaign
- Create requests to withdraw money
- Contribute in a project
- Approve request to spend money (only if you're contributor)
- Finalize request to send amount 

It still is a very simple application. I'm planning to update it as soon as possible, with some cool features.

## Future Plans

- Details about campaign (title, description, attachment)
- User Profile (name, profile picture)
- NFT integration (profile picture, campaign proposal)
- Custom ERC20 Token Support
